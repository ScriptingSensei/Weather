# Weather
Developed a weather application using Python, incorporating tkinter for the graphical user interface and requests for fetching weather data from online APIs. Utilized PIL (Pillow) for image handling, allowing users to view weather conditions with graphical icons. The application provides real-time weather updates and a user-friendly interface for an enhanced user experience.
